Hi I'm Imaculate, welcome to the internet home of pretty things I make. 

![This is me][1]

My earrings often make an entrance before I do. I like them big, fun and bold. I'm constantly amazed at how such a small accesory can be so powerful. With a single pair, I can manifest my spirit animal, channel my superhero, relive the moments bundled in a gift, dress the part, simply match an outfit or all of the above. These are the ingredients that make up Yellow Helix Designs. With yellow as the color for fun, **Yellow Helix** stands for the fun DNA that resides in all of us. I just provide the medium to express it.

I'm based out of Washington but but my journey started in Tanzania where I grew up and learnt the values of authenticity, connection and community. These are the values I infuse into my jewellery. It is my honor to share my craft with the world.
